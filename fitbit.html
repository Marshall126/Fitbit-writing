        <h2>Are fitbits a positive piece of technology?</h2>
        <p>
            Fitbits are a popular brand of activity trackers, little electronics that track your activity throughout the day, but they may be more malevolent than they appear.
            According to Business Insider, “A new study in the Journal of Consumer Research seems to indicate that measuring an activity, whatever it is, decreases people's motivation to keep up with it” (8).
            It seems that people who wear Fitbits often have less motivation to exercise than people who don’t have a tracker of any kind.
            The primary goal of a Fitbit is to encourage exercise, yet strangely, it often does the exact opposite.
            The Guardian, in an article of a similar nature, said, "Seventy-nine percent reported feeling under pressure to reach targets...”(9).
            The majority of people who wear Fitbits feel pressured into reaching the goals they set.
            Motivation through pressure ultimately fails due to the motivation being produced through fear of failure, rather than by aspirations of success.
            The article continued saying, “...while 30% even felt the device was an enemy and made them feel guilty" (9).
            Roughly ⅓ of all fitbit users felt guilty for not reaching the goals, and even viewed the tracker as an enemy. 
            People don’t like to feel negative emotions such as guilt, and will most likely give up on using the fitbit eventually due to all of the negative emotions it caused.
            In addition, 43% of users felt that their activities were wasted (9).
            Almost half of all users thought that the exercise they went through to appease the Fitbit were wasted.
            The feeling of wasted time is one of the most frustrating emotions someone could go through, and very few people would have the motivation to continue when feeling that their previous efforts were wasted. 
            All in all, Fitbits motivate people in the wrong way, which will inevitably lead to frustration and giving up.
