        <h2>What is the correlation between steps taken each day and student performance?</h2>
        <p>
            The dumb jock, the smart nerd, these stereotypes have existed for what seems like forever, but new research shows that they might not be accurate.
            One study found that students who exhibited higher physical activity generally had greater academic success (1).
            Students who exercised more got better grades than their more sedentary peers.
            It seems than an effective strategy for increasing grades would be getting more exercise, despite popular belief.
            Another study concluded that, "Students who get regular physical education and exercise are better able to concentrate when they are in the classroom. Exercise can help reduce asthma symptoms, a major cause of student absenteeism, especially in low-income areas. Regular exercise can alleviate stress, anxiety, and depression — all problems that can affect school performance — and can even boost self-esteem" (2).
            Many ailments that get in the way of school are lessened by exercise.
            Students who have issues with high stress and anxiety levels may be having these problems due to being inactive.
            A prime example of a school benefitting from active students is the district of McComb, IL, which after having added a physical education program to its courses, rose from the 59th best school to the 14th best in the state, and caused dropout rates to fall 20% (3).
            Schools benefit from active students just as much as the students do, since they have more motivation to continue school.
            Schools that have issues with underperforming and unmotivated students should look first towards the quality of their physical education program as a possible culprit.
            A research paper found the cause for all of these benefits to exercise, informing that, "[Exercise causes] increased oxygen flow to the brain, increased brain neurotransmitters, [increased] brain-derived neurotrophins that support neuronal differentiation and survival in the developing brain. Neurotrophins assure the survival of neurons in areas responsible for learning, memory, and higher thinking!" (4).
            Exercise changes the brain in many ways that facilitate learning.
            Clearly, physical activity is just as important as mental activity in school, since the brain will not learn well if the body is not healthy.
            Overall, physical activity should never be ignored for students, or they may have difficulty in school.
