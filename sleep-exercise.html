        <h2>Does Sleep Lead to Exercise?</h2>
        <p>
            Activity has been shown to have a link with sleep in the past, but is the reverse true? This may be the case, as a study done on this very subject found that,
            "In general, adults with poor sleep were less active than similar adults without sleep discrepancies" (10).
            Adults that did not get enough sleep at night were not as active as their peers in the study. 
            It appears that sleep is required in order to have the motivation to exercise.
            The article goes further, stating, "Studies have found that nightly variations in various sleep parameters...predict physical activty behavior the following day" (10).
            Sleep quality appears to have a direct relationship with exercise that occurs the following day. 
            The link between between sleep is so strong, that a drastic shift in sleep would most likely be accompanied with a drastic shift in exercise.
            Another study showed another link between sleep and activity, informing that a group of athletes reported better sprint times, more endurance, slower heart rate, and a higher overall quality of exercise (11).
            During exercise, better rested athletes had all kinds of performance gains than their more tired counterparts.
            Even if someone who is tired is able to muster up the motivation to work out, they would still perform noticeably worse than an equally strong person with plenty of energy.
            Furthermore, the study states, "Without enough quality sleep, your body cannot fully recover from exercise" (11). 
            In short, the body will ache longer after exercising if sleep requirements are not met. The downsides to exercising while tired continue even after the activity.
            To investigate this relationship between sleep and exercise, I wore a fitbit for 15 days and recorded my sleep and exercise. This data can be found in the graph below. 
            You may be asking, "This data completely disproves the point you just made!" and while it may seem that you are correct, my method of collection was flawed.
            Most of the exercise I get is out of my control, with the vast majority of it being my daily walk to school. 
            This makes it so that weekends have disproportionately low amounts of steps, which also happen to be the days where I get the most amount of sleep.
            With all of this in mind, it's clear that sleep and exercise are closely related.
