        <h2>Does Sleep Lead to Exercise?</h2>
        <p>
            Activity has been shown to have a link with sleep in the past, but is the reverse true? This may be the case, as a study done on this very subject found that,
            "In general, adults with poor sleep were less active than similar adults without sleep discrepancies" (10).
            Adults that did not get enough sleep at night were not as active as their peers in the study. 
            It appears that sleep is required in order to have the motivation to exercise.
            The article goes further, stating, "Studies have found that nightly variations in various sleep paremeters...predict physical activty behavior the following day" (10).
            Sleep quality appears to have a direct relationship with exercise that occurs the following day. 
            The link between between sleep is so strong, that a drastic shift in sleep would most likely be accompanied with a drastic shift in exercise.
            Another study showed another link between sleep and activity, informing that A group of athletes reported better sprint times, more endurance, slower heart rate, and a higher overall quality of exercise (11).
            During exercise, better rested athletes had all kinds of performance gains than their more tired counterparts.
            Even if someone who is tired is able to muster up the motivation to work out, they would still perform noticeably worse than an equally strong person with plenty of energy.
            Furthermore, the study states, "Without enough quality sleep, your body cannot fully recover from exercise" (11). 
            In short, the body will ache longer after exercising if sleep requirements are not met. The downsides to exercising while tired continue even after the activity.
            With all of this in mind, it's clear that sleep and exercise are incredibly closely related.
