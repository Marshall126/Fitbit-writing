        <h2>Does Sleep Improve Work Efficiency?</h2>
        <p>
            When work picks up, sleep is often the first thing sacrificed, but in reality sleep is crucial for staying efficient.
            A study on sleep in university students showed that, “[Lack of sleep] is associated with lower grades, incompletion of courses, as well as negative moods."(5)
            Students who do not get sufficient sleep are much more academically challenged than their peers.
            Undoubtedly, sleep is just as important as studying, if not more, and thus should never be skipped in favor of more study time.
            Not only this, but students who do not get proper sleep are more likely to engage in procrastination (5).
            Ironically, the study time gained from not properly sleeping is then lost from procrastination caused by the lack of sleep.
            Sleeping enough at night will pay off in more effective use of time.
            Officevibe, on the subject of sleep in students, said that, “One study of middle school students found that ‘delaying school start times by one hour, from roughly 7:30 to 8:30, increases standardized test scores by at least 2 percentile points in math and 1 percentile point in reading.’” (6)
            In short, giving students more time before having to wake up and go to school caused these students to get better test scores.
            Schools have much to gain by giving students more time to sleep, since the standardized tests that schools revolve around are easier for students who have gotten sufficient rest.
            Another study elaborated that, "...better sleep quality and lower scores on chronic sleep reduction were associated with better study concentration" (7).
            Not only do students procrastinate less and retain information better with sleep, but they are much more focused during study time.
            In conclusion, the best preparation for a week of studying and testing is a good night's rest.
